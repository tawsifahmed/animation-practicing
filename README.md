I was given a problem to solve, here is the description, 

* Make a square box of any pixels  which will loop from top left to bottom right of the screen,
 1. First do the task using css key-frames
 2. Do the task using pure javascript
 3. Now using pure javascript, add arrows to the direction of the box, if the box moves right/left/up/down, then the right/left/up/down arrows should be inserted.
 4. After inserting arrows in the following directions, make them disappear after a particular time, the will reappear when the box reaches either one side of the corners of the screen.
